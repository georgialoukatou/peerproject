they were told to entertain xxx [>] downstairs .
when we were upstairs <on the outside> [>] terrace .
yes yes .
and his children looked after our <xxx children> [>] .
for lunch .
and they ate the chickens .
we realized she was a vegetarian mother so we realized we wouldn't take the chicken out in front of her .
so Richard xxx [>] xxx .
anyway suddenly one of the twins who's fifteen said excuse me Daddy but can one of the grownups come downstairs to clear away the chicken bones because we can't touch them .
and .
oh no .
our children had left chicken bones they had been eating it with their fingers all over xxx .
