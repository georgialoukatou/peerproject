the socialist .
leader of our socialist group .
hm: .
he says quite a_lot_of people of his are poor haven't got a telephone and things like that .
they've got_to be written to .
I know yes .
it seems difficult .
they can ask them to ring back from a phone box or something .

I'm offering them to you first .

what are they called ?
xxx well it's very nice actually it's in a salad .
a little vine salad which is more green than this .

and it's in a really nice fishy sauce .
so I got tinned ones one day to see what xxx [>] .
<I put my battery back Mummy > [<] [>] her .
and they keep them xxx .
well he wasn't because he was very embarrassed because it had to be kept well away from the children well .
his wife and really his children .
and they his children were very good very polite .
they were told to entertain xxx [>] downstairs .
<Mummie > [<] .
when we were upstairs <on the outside> [>] terrace .
<Mummie > [<] .
yes yes .
and his children looked after our <xxx children> [>] .
Mummie .
for lunch .
here you are .
and they ate the chickens .
we realized she was a vegetarian mother so we realized we wouldn't take the chicken out in front of her .
so Richard xxx [>] xxx .
<Mummie > [<] .
anyway suddenly one of the twins who's fifteen said excuse me Daddy but can one of the grownups come downstairs to clear away the chicken bones because we can't touch them .
and .
oh no .
our children had left chicken bones they had been eating it with their fingers all over xxx .
can you imagine anything more awful for vegetarians ?
and they were very polite the girls they were very xxx .
but they were very sorry they were quite happy to do the washing up but we can't touch the chicken bones .

xxx talking to Sheila and trying to make friends with her .

only if Sheila doesn't want to come to our Europe party .
he might bring Tess xxx .
so (3.) .
how old is she ?
seventeen (4.) .
but &-um she can be very charming .
he went to a garden party in Oxford recently and she was very charming .
he took her as his lady you know .
all the girls wore long dresses and all the men wore their gowns .
<and xxx university was very> [>] formal .
<yes yes yes yes> [<] .
but as she saw a writer there who was looking very lonely .
a lady writer .
and was awfully charming to her .
lady in her fifties she was all alone in a corner very badly dressed and looking very miserable .
but she's very well known .
and Tess went over and said I've read three novels of yours lately and started to talk to her .
and really made her feel that she belonged to <the same atmosphere> [>] and was very kind .
and apparently they were very impressed with how she was . .
that's nice at that age .
well quite xxx .
well the other one you know she wouldn't have been able to do that .
this is the difference in character and personality .
Tess is the eldest .
no one of the two twins the eldest is Celia whose nearly nineteen .
